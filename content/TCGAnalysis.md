Statistical analysis of Glioblastoma Multiforme data taken from The Cancer
Genome Altas (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/), to compare the production of cancer cells across the individuals represented in the data. This analysis is expected to facilitate understanding the behavior of cancer cells in the brain of a given population used in research of methods to control or reduce the production of these cells.

	Glioblastoma Multiforme (known by the acronym GBM) is a fast-growing brain tumor, composed of a heterogeneous mixture of poorly differentiated astrocytic tumor cells with pleomorphic, necrosis, vascular proliferation and frequent mitosis. It can occur at any age but mainly affects adults between 45 and 70 years. It usually occurs in the cerebral hemispheres, is less common location in the brainstem or spinal cord. Like all brain tumors, except in very rare cases, it does not expand beyond the structures of the central nervous system.
	
	The project is as a collaboration between [Pablo E. Vivas Mejia](http://rcmi.rcm.upr.edu/investigators/research_interest_pdf/DrPabloVivas.pdf) and [MegaProbe]({filename}/pages/about.md).
