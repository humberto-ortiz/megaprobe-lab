## Bio:

My name is Isaac Hiram Lopez Diaz. I am a Master's student at Computer Science at UPRRP.
Besides computer science and programming, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, and the beach.

## Research Goals
- Contribute to the land of Programming Languages
- Understand and apply Type Theory
- Understand Homotopy Type Theory

## Research Description

My research consists of implementing a type checker and interpreter for the RAISE Specification Language (RSL).
The hope is that the type checker can later be extended to the semantics of a general purpose language.

## Weekly UPDATES
### Week 1: (10-14, 3, 2025)
- Developed scanner for the Language (partially, but mostly completed).
- Developed a small parser combinator library in order to reuse it whenever language is extended.
- Developed small weakest-precondition evaluator
