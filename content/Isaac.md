## Bio:

My name is Isaac Hiram Lopez Diaz. I am a Master's student at Computer Science at UPRRP.
Besides computer science and programming, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, and the beach.

## Research Goals
- Contribute to the land of Programming Languages
- Understand and apply Type Theory
- Understand Homotopy Type Theory
- Find the Fourth Futamura Projection :laughing:

## Research Description

My research consists of implementing a type checker and interpreter for the RAISE Specification Language (RSL).
The hope is that the type checker can later be extended to the semantics of a general purpose language.

## Weekly UPDATES
### Week 1: (10-14, 3, 2025)
- Developed scanner for the Language (partially, but mostly completed).
- Developed a small parser combinator library in order to reuse it whenever language is extended.
- Develop scanner for RAISE in Scheme.
- Implement some parser combinators in Scheme.
- Reading The Seasoned Schemer up to chapter (1)6.
- Discuss with professor focus on evaluating S-Expressions to develop AST subset and evaluator.

### Week 2: (17-21, 3, 2025)
- Read an axiomatic basis for Computer Programming
- Read on semantics of programming languages
- Started developing the Weakest Precondition (Predicate Calculus)

### Week 3: (24-28, 3, 2025)
- Developed weakest precondition for skip, abort, sequence, and if expressions
- Gave presentation of updates
- Decided to pursue on proving a 2 line program using weakest precondition
- Keep developing scanner for the language
