# Bio:
 - French Horn player 📯
 - Computer Science Student 
 - Trying to learn new things every day
 - Someday I'll like to help people with the things I do    

# Research Goals

By being part of the MegapProbe Lab I aim to improve my research abilities and learn a new set of skills that will help me become better scientist.

# Additional Goals
- Learn how to hack like Humberto
- Learn how to juggle

## Second Semester 2019-2020

### Weekly UPDATES (LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...)

#### Week 2: (3-7/Feb)
- This week we were working on the abstract for the SIDIM that will take place on March 6, 2020 
- We ran diffhash and started to read the code to see how we can implement the bloom filter and the count-min sketch. Hopefully we gonna have something more solid for next week. 

#### Week 1: (27-31/Jan)
- I had a meeting with Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga, PhD, where we discussed the things we were going to be doing this semester.
	- I'll be retaking the diffhash project but this time I'm going to be replacing the hash function that diffhash is currently using for a bloom filter and a count-min sketch (trying to take a probabilistic aproach to see if we can make some improvements)

## First Semester 2019-2020

#### Week 15-End: (Nov 25 - the end)
- I am barely alive... I talked to Dr. Ortiz-Zuazaga about some problems I had with my schedule and the plan for the next semester. Hopefully I can do better next year :)

#### Week 14-15: (18-22/Nov)
- Dr. Ortiz-Zuazaga tried to help us resolve the compatibility problems with the required packages but we couldn't address the problem and run the program. 
- Humberto Concluded that it was almost impossible to meet all the requirements for the preprocessing of D-GEX and we started the search for more papers on the same topic.  

#### Week 13: (11-15/Nov)
- Luis asked for the data to the scientist that published the paper and they answered super fast.
- We tried to run the program from the GitHub repository of the project but we couldn't pass the preprocessing of D-GEX because of all the version issues

#### Week 12: (4-8/Nov)
- Back from SACNAS... I hace like 1Kw (Kilo works, it's a standard unit of measurement hehe)
- Humberto assigned me to work with Luis since seq-seq-pan was a an already working program with little to improve (and that little required Java)

#### Week 11: (28-1/Oct-Nov)
- I went to the SACNAS Conference at Hawai'i
	- __Note__: Dear Mega-Probers: If you have 7 classes, do not attend to any conference... it was a bad idea :)

#### Week 10: (21-25/Oct)
- Dr. Ortiz-Zuazaga Repaired Hulk!! \#hulkIsBiggerThanEver.
- I was learning how to run the code from the seq-seq-pan github but I found some problems on the way
- Learning how to use Mauve (a tool to plot the output of seq-seq-pan)
- Presented the Seq-Seq-Pan paper with a live demo of the Mauve tool.

#### Week 9: (14-18/Oct)
- Dr. Ortiz-Zuazaga was trying to install a new graphic card into Hulk but so that we could implement a deep learning approach. However, there where compatibility problems with the old graphic and the newone.
- \#hulkWasDown
- Lab meeting canceled, professor had a meeting.

#### Week 8: (7-11/Oct)
- I was reading the seq-seq-pan paper to presented on the lab meeting.
- Lab meeting was canceled due to BSidesPR Conference.

#### Week 7: (30-4/Sep-Oct)
+ Didn't have the chance to work this week.

#### Week 6: (23-27/Sep)
- I went to the lab meeting to see Robertito's presentation, it was a very bad paper but Dr. Ortiz-Zuazaga got an idea out of it, so they are going to work on that

#### Week 5: (16-20/Sep)
- I found a program called Mauve that look's like a good tool for the idea of the Pan-genome

#### Week 4: (9-13/Sep)
- I presented the Deepfinder paper in the Journal Club
- I'm trying to find possibles ways to create the pan-genome of the butterflies

#### Week 3: (2-6/Sep)
- I started working with Steven Van Belleghem using butterfly data to create a Pan-genome
- Lab metting cancelled

#### Week 2: (26-30/Aug)
- I selected the paper "DeepFinder: An integration of feature-based and deep learning approach for DNA motif discovery." to present it at the Journal Club.

#### Week 1: (19-23/Aug)
- We discussed possible ideas for projects
	- We were contemplating the use of machine learning on Papa's project

## Second Semester 2018-2019

#### Week 8: (04-08/Mar)
- I FINALLY PULLED!!
- This week I am going to start reading a paper about a "better implamentation" using kmers https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101271
- Also I am going to work with Roberto trying to run more examples in diffhash using the polyester database.

#### Week 7: (25-01/Feb-Mar)
- I was dealing with a lot of jobs from the past week and could not do many progress.

#### Week 6: (18-22/Feb)
- I was studing for Abstract Algebra and Algorithms and didn't have time do anything else this week.

#### Week 5: (11-15/Feb)
- Angel took the the diffhash project and he will make it work with any fastq formated file.

#### Week 4: (4-8/Feb)
- I moved diffhash to Hulk because Humberto told that using R-Studio my life would be much better. Then when I started running the program and it suddently crashed and this happened:

	- Me: Professor, I think I broke something
	- Humberto: Let me see the code...
	- (10 seconds scrolling through the code)
	- Humberto: You are missing an "@." right there.
	- Everything started to run perfectly well.

#### Week 3: (28-01/Jan-Feb)
- It's been a week trying to run diffhash but I haven't been able to make it run from tip to tail. I thought bioinformatics was a little bit easier 🤔

#### Week 2: (21-25/Jan)
- Using the eelpondworkshop file in boqueron to run the escambron protocols in order to use real data in the program (diffhash) that our Benevolent Dictator created.
- Trying to understant how diffhash works.

#### Week 1: (14-18/Jan)
- I am trying to set some order/priorities in my life
