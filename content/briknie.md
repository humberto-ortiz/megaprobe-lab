# Bio:
 - French Horn player 📯
 - Computer Science Student 
 - Trying to learn new things every day
 - Someday I'll like to help people with the things I do    

# Research Goals

By being part of the MegapProbe Lab I aim to improve my research abilities and learn a new set of skills that will help me become better scientist.

# Additional Goals
- Learn how to hack like Humberto
- Learn how to juggle

## First Semester 2019-2020

### Weekly UPDATES (LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...)

#### Week 5: (16-20/Sep)
- I found a program called Mauve that look's like a good tool for the idea of the Pan-genome

#### Week 4: (9-13/Sep)
- I presented the Deepfinder paper in the Journal Club
- I'm trying to find possibles ways to create the pan-genome of the butterflies

#### Week 3: (2-6/Sep)
- I started working with Steven Van Belleghem using butterfly data to create a Pan-genome
- Lab metting cancelled

#### Week 2: (26-30/Aug)
- I selected the paper "DeepFinder: An integration of feature-based and deep learning approach for DNA motif discovery." to present it at the Journal Club.

#### Week 1: (19-23/Aug)
- We discussed possible ideas for projects
	- We were contemplating the use of machine learning on Papa's project

## Second Semester 2018-2019

#### Week 8: (04-08/Mar)
- I FINALLY PULLED!!
- This week I am going to start reading a paper about a "better implamentation" using kmers https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101271
- Also I am going to work with Roberto trying to run more examples in diffhash using the polyester database.

#### Week 7: (25-01/Feb-Mar)
- I was dealing with a lot of jobs from the past week and could not do many progress.

#### Week 6: (18-22/Feb)
- I was studing for Abstract Algebra and Algorithms and didn't have time do anything else this week.

#### Week 5: (11-15/Feb)
- Angel took the the diffhash project and he will make it work with any fastq formated file.

#### Week 4: (4-8/Feb)
- I moved diffhash to Hulk because Humberto told that using R-Studio my life would be much better. Then when I started running the program and it suddently crashed and this happened:

	- Me: Professor, I think I broke something
	- Humberto: Let me see the code...
	- (10 seconds scrolling through the code)
	- Humberto: You are missing an "@." right there.
	- Everything started to run perfectly well.

#### Week 3: (28-01/Jan-Feb)
- It's been a week trying to run diffhash but I haven't been able to make it run from tip to tail. I thought bioinformatics was a little bit easier 🤔

#### Week 2: (21-25/Jan)
- Using the eelpondworkshop file in boqueron to run the escambron protocols in order to use real data in the program (diffhash) that our Benevolent Dictator created.
- Trying to understant how diffhash works.

#### Week 1: (14-18/Jan)
- I am trying to set some order/priorities in my life
