# Biography :memo:
Konichiwa! My name is Walter Báez Laguna and I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus. 
I major in Computer Sciences and also cheer for the Cheerleading Team at the Campus. My short term goal is to finsih my career with the
neccesary tools and accomplishments to suffice my future company or corporation. Currently, I'm still quite a novice but I'm working
to change that with the learning experience I get from my classes and my new investigation using Stack to find SNPs in RADSeq. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ 

## Hobbies :space_invader:
- I love video games! All different kinds, from MOBAs to Shooters, RPGs and MMOs, everything honestly. :video_game:
- I'm also an anime and manga fan. :octocat:
- Sleep and eating should count as hobbies. :pizza:
- Some sports are fun to do like swimming, volleyball and of course Cheerleading. :swimmer:
- Science Fiction and Fantasy books are life to me :books:
- Last but not least spend some time browsing the internet finding new projects and interesting codes. :ghost:

# Research Goals :microscope:
- Learn more about Stack and how to use it properly.
- Understand more about RADSeq data.
- Have a successful outcome out of the research. 
- Produce a relevant denovo_map to conclude the genomic comparison. 

# Research Description :open_file_folder:
- Use Stack to analyze RADSeq data to find SNPs across the Species Red Snappers.
- Conlude if lutjanus campechanus or purpureus are different species or the same one.
- Make Stack's pipeline work for once.

# Weekly Updates :date:
## Week 16 (December 9, 2016 to December 16, 2016) :clock1:
- The VM is still not set up and we are stuck once again.
- TBA...

## Week 14 & 15 (November 25th, 2016 to December 9, 2016) :clock1:
- It took some time to get the approval, but we got it!
- Sad part is we couldn't set up the VM, it's giving us some issues since we are making
  with this new recipe to have more memory.

## Week 12 & 13 (November 11, 2016 to November 25, 2016) :clock1:
- Our options started to be less each time and we came up with another idea.
- Build a better bigger VM in Makaria (where I was previously working on) this
  way I could work in it without the administrator dilema and have the help,  
  memory and speed I need.

## Week 10 & 11 (October 28, 2016 to November 11, 2016) :clock1:
- The VM was set up, we uploaded a few files and we ran the pipeline to see if the denovo_map
  would work or if we could spot the problems.
- It took forever, literally it was running for like 3 weeks and it only did about 5 out of 20.

## Week 8 & 9 (October 14, 2016 to October 28, 2016) :clock1:
- I decided to work in the lab with my professor where I could get more advice and help
  since I the administrator settings and limited help was beginning to be another issue.
- The strategy was to set up a virtual machine so we can run a small test and view how 
  does Stack work and figure out the problems.

## Week 6 & 7 (September 30th, 2016 to October 14, 2016) :clock1:
- We started to have a lot of problems with the database for the output of the pipeline.
- Administration problems, failed uploads, repetitive data, missing fails.
- The error could not be easily fixed so we went and talked with a few peopel about it.

## Week 4 & 5 (September 16, 2016 to September 30th, 2016) :clock1:
- The time was spent trying to understand the Stack pipeline to run the entire program.
- We ran a few commands using the manual until there was no more further information for 
  denovo map logs without a reference genome. 
- Everything was put together so we can start our first denovo_map and it was left running.

## Week 2 & 3 (September 2nd, 2016 to September 16, 2016) :clock1:
- We started working with the data that arrivied, 160 GB of raw data.
- First steps were using fastqc to review the data, trimming and cleaning it.

## Week 1 (August 21ft, 2016 to September 2nd, 2016) :clock1:
- Arrieved at the lab, met the professors and received my instructions.
- Read the Stack presentation and manual given to me at the lab.
- Waiting on the RADSeq data that hasn't arrived and on more instructions.
- There was no one on the lab (Sept. 2nd) because they went fishing for more research individuals 
  so I went and did my hours creating my GitHub and setting up my Weekly Reports.
