#Short Bio:
  
   Greetings, my name is David John Ortiz Rivera. I was born one august day in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, but raised in Morovis (yes, we have electricity). 
   Currently a 4th year undergrad student at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras. I'm primarily interested in programming, video games, music (except Bachata), films, and science (somewhat).
   In the future I aspire to use what I learn from my undergrad (& grad) program to do something productive,
   or atleast relate it to any of my interests.

  + Weekly progress rating 45/100.
  

###Week 8 (14th of October, 2016 to 21st of October, 2016)

###Week 7 (7th of October, 2016 to 14th of October, 2016)
  
  + Troubleshooting error with Individual03. Turns out that Trinity needed a large amount of RAM (256G).
  + Started running the following scripts: Individual03, Tissue01.
  + Weekly progress rating 70/100.

###Week 6 (30th of September, 2016 to 7th of October, 2016)
  
  + Ran first Trinity script in hulk using screen commands. It was somewhat a success.
  + Started scripts for Individual02 & Individual03. Succeded only with Individual02.
  + Weekly progress rating 30/100. 

###Week 5 (23rd of September, 2016 to 30th of September, 2016)
  
  + Installed Trinity in my Makaira directory (with the help of Humberto) to avoid further problems.
  + Moved my data to HULK.
  + Weekly progress rating 20/100. 

###Week 4 (16th of September, 2016 to 23rd of September, 2016)
  
  + Makaira's Trinity kept encountering errors due to the lack of plugins.
  + Managed to download 2 Astyanax and 4 Cave/Surface fish Transcriptome files for future work.
  + Power outtage suspended all lab work after Wednesday.
  + Weekly progress rating 20/100.

###Week 3 (9th of September, 2016 to 16th of September, 2016)
  
  + Finally met with instructor (important).
  + Took Trinity tutorial.
  + I was given data and a reference script to start assembly.
  + Created 7 scripts based on reference script and tinkering.
  + Created additional script to download cavefish and surface fish data from SRA.
  + Sadly, Trinity needs some plugins installed and SRA needs to be installed on Makaira
     for me to be able to use my scripts.
  + Weekly progress rating 30/100. 

###Week 2 (2nd of September, 2016 to 9th of September, 2016)

###Week 1 (26th of August, 2016 to 2nd of September, 2016):
  
  + Recieved instructions to start gathering 'raw data' on different
      species of cave fishes.
  + Obtained data from NCBI, currently waiting on confirmation from
      my instructor if it's correct to proceed with assembling.
  + Sadly no progress.
